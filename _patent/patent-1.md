<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Abstract</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The invention discloses a method and a system for predicting the box-office performance of movies on the basis of neural network algorithms, and belongs to the field of technologies for processing data. The method includes steps of 1, selecting M box-office performance influence factors; 2, analyzing correlation according to box-office performance influence indexes the M box-office performance influence factors of offline movies and the box-office performance of the offline movies; 3, determining the numbers N of neurons of input layers of neural networks and the numbers of neurons of output layers; 4, determining box-office performance influence indexes of N box-office performance main influence factors of the to-be-predicted movies and determining the predicted box-office performance of the to-be-predicted movies according to output results of the neural networks. The numbers K of the neurons of the output layers are the numbers of sections of the box-office performance. The method and the system have the advantages that the integral intact system for predicting the box-office performance of the movies is established, is accurate in prediction and has positive significance on development of the movie industry in China.</p>
