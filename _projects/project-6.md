<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was mainly to label hotels in the hotel and homestay channel of Meituan APP with different scenarios.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goals of the project were to establish a scenario-based label system for Meituan hotels and travel, meet users' various hotel needs, improve users' order decision-making efficiency, and increase the visit-to-purchase rate and paid room nights of hotels in different scenarios.</p>

 
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the visit-to-purchase rate for newly added tags such as "Ancient Town Stroll," "Sea View Room," and "Food Street" increased by an average of 3% compared to the overall market. Optimized tags like "Couple Dating" and "Riverside" experienced a 1% increase in the visit-to-purchase rate, with the "Couple Dating" tag contributing an additional 957 paid room nights per week.</p>
