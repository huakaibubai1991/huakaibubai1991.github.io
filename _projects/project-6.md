The project is mainly to label hotels in the hotel and homestay channel of Meituan APP with different scenarios.

In the end, the visit-to-purchase rate of pure new labels such as sea view room and ancient town walk increased by an average of 3% compared with the overall market, and the visit-to-purchase rate of optimized labels such as couple dating and riverside increased by 1% compared with before optimization, and the paid room nights of the couple dating label increased by 957 in one week.
