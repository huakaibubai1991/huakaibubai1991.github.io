<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is mainly to label hotels in the hotel and homestay channel of Meituan APP with different scenarios.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of the project is to establish a scenario-based label system for Meituan hotels and travel, meet users' various hotel needs, improve users' order decision-making efficiency, and increase the visit-to-purchase rate and paid room nights of hotels in different scenarios.</p>

 
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the visit-to-purchase rate of pure new labels such as sea view room and ancient town walk increased by an average of 3% compared with the overall market, and the visit-to-purchase rate of optimized labels such as couple dating and riverside increased by 1% compared with before optimization, and the paid room nights of the couple dating label increased by 957 in one week.</p>
