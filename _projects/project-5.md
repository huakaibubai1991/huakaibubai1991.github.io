<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was mainly to create a must-stay list for the hotel and homestay channel of Meituan APP, including a city list and a national special list.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goals of the project were:
(1) to select high-quality hotels from all hotels on Meituan APP;
(2) to select special categories from all hotels on Meituan APP;
(3) to find hotels that meet the special categories from high-quality hotels.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the must-stay list was launched on the hotel channels of the Meituan app, resulting in a significant increase in traffic for the listed hotels. Additionally, the promotion of the list enhanced the willingness of high-end hotels to collaborate with Meituan Hotels.</p>
