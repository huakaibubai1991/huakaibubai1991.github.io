<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is mainly to create a must-stay list for the hotel and homestay channel of Meitu APP, including a city list and a national special list.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goals of the project were:
(1) to select high-quality hotels from all hotels on Meituan APP;
(2) to select special categories from all hotels on Meituan APP;
(3) to find hotels that meet the special categories from high-quality hotels.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the must-stay list was finally launched on the Meituan and Dianping hotel channels. The traffic of the listed hotels has increased significantly compared to before the list was listed. The spread of the list has also increased the willingness of high-end hotels to cooperate with Meituan Hotels.</p>
