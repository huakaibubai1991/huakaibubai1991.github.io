<p style="text-align: justify;">The project mainly stratified Meitu users based on different algorithm models and business logic and built a user stratification system with labels such as users' life cycle, activity stratification, date type preference, time segment preference, churn probability prediction, etc.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goals of this project were to accurately segment user groups according to different business scenarios and implement targeted strategies based on the characteristics of each group. This approach aimed to improve the business conversion rate while maximizing user value with fewer resources and lower costs.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the users' activity stratification label of the Meitu community was applied to push, and the CTR increased by 4.767%.</p>
