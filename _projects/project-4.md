<p style="text-align: justify;">The project mainly stratifies Meitu users based on different algorithm models and business logics, and builds a user stratification system with labels such as user life cycle, user activity stratification, user date type preference, user time period preference, and user churn probability prediction, etc.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of this project is to accurately segment user groups according to different business scenarios, and implement targeted operation strategies based on the characteristics of different groups, so as to improve the business conversion rate of each group and tap into greater user value with fewer resources and costs.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the active stratification labels of Xiuxiu Community users were applied to push, and the CTR increased by 4.767%; the date type preference and time period preference features were applied to user age stage prediction, and the accuracy rate increased from 60% to 66%.</p>
