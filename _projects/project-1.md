<p style="text-align: justify;">This project mainly uses machine learning and deep learning models to predict the age stage of Meitu users.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of this project is to enhance the accuracy of age stage prediction and expand the coverage of the user age stage label. The project primarily developed three versions of the model, employing the following methods:</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">(1) Established Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict the age stages of Meitu users based on user portrait labels, community consumption behaviors, tool click behaviors, and other features, achieving an initial accuracy of 45% and then implemented a stacking model of LR, Random Forest, and XGBoost, which increased the model accuracy to 50%.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">(2) Segmented the words, filtered out special characters and stop words, calculated the TF-IDF value to vectorize the features based on the text information of users in the Xiuxiu community, used the chi-square test for feature selection, and established a Spark MLP model to predict the age stage of Meitu users, achieving an accuracy of 52%.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">(3) Established a decision tree model to predict the age stage of Meitu users based on the userâ€™s portrait label, community consumption behaviors, tool click behaviors, and other features, with a model accuracy of 60% and added the user date type preference and user time segment preference based on the previous features to establish the LightGBM model, with a model accuracy increased from 60% to 66%.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, the models predicted the age stage of hundreds of millions of Meitu users, with the accuracy rate increasing from 45% to 66%.</p>
